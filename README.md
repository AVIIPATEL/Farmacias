#Farmacias Extremadura

### Description

The intention of this project is to provide the users of Extremadura(a region in Spain) with an app to check out regularly where 
the nearby pharmacies are. The app will contain a google v2 map with markers to show all pharmacies at once. A bottom sheet under
the map will show some indicators, for example, whether the pharmacy is open or not, the phone number and the direction. A fab
will give the possibility to the user to use Google directions to check the route and distance to the destination pharmacy.


### Notes

The project is now under development.
